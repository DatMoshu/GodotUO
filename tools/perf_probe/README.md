# tools/perf_probe

Frame time in fixed scenes (Epic B, B1): runs the desktop client with
`--perf-probe`, windowed and never taking the focus, against a shard where the
probe account is a GM. It measures the login screen, an open field, the
Britain bank, a dense forest and a dungeon, then a run through ground loading
into view, and writes `build/perf/perf_<label>.md` and `.json`. Frame times
compare only on one machine; draw calls and batcher counts compare anywhere.
On Android, the Deck or the web run the client with the same flags.

## Run

```
python tools/perf_probe/run.py [--label NAME] [--port PORT] [--args "--batched-world"] [--size 1280,720]
python tools/perf_probe/run.py --compare A B
```

## Tests

No automated tests: the run itself is the check, and its exit code says whether it passed.
